## What is this

I like listening to Terence. [This](https://www.organism.earth/library/author/terence-mckenna) has a lot of the lectures with a lot of meta-data, well-structured. But I needed a way to oragnise my ideas, distill them, do some analysis on the lectures, move them towards becoming essays. So I've decided to build something that can help me with this. It probably won't make a lot of sense to anybody else for now, but I'm hoping I can make it a little more universally useful. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
