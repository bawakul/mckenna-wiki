# 04-07 Human Verification Feedback

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Issues found

## Issues

1. **Highlight button does nothing** (BLOCKING)
   - Text selection works, Highlight button appears
   - Clicking the button has no effect
   - Annotation is not created

2. **Sidebar colors wrong** (minor)
   - Sidebar appears black/grey instead of white background
   - Not blocking but visually incorrect

3. **Sidebar toggle placement** (defer)
   - User not a fan of placement
   - Will address later, not blocking

## Next Steps

- Fix highlight button click handler (priority)
- Debug why createAnnotation is not being called or failing
- Check sidebar styling
